            <p>our <strong>zen</strong>:</p>
            <q><br>
                In the age of endless mirrors,<br>
                where every action reflects a thousandfold,<br>
                privacy is the clearing in the woods—<br>
                a place to rest, to think, to be.<br>

                The bird that sings in the open sky<br>
                sings freely, but it is vulnerable.<br>
                The bird that nests in quiet shadows<br>
                finds safety, space, and time to heal.<br>

                Privacy is the soil in which the roots grow,<br>
                hidden from the world yet nourishing life.<br>
                Without it, the tree weakens,<br>
                its foundation exposed to harsh winds.<br>
                <br>
                To guard privacy is not to hide;<br>
                it is to honor the sacred sanctuary of the self.<br>
                It is where dreams form, where truth dwells,<br>
                where freedom is born.<br>
                <br>
                In giving too much,<br>
                we risk forgetting what is ours to keep.<br>
                In keeping what is ours,<br>
                we protect the strength to give more deeply.<br>
                <br>
                Cherish the unseen,<br>
                for in it lies the core of your humanity.<br>
                Walk lightly in the world’s light,<br>
                but never forsake the shadows that sustain you.<br>
